# Local development
Run this API locally. Then access from `http://localhost:8000` on a web browser. `docker-compose.yml` defines the local environment.
```
docker-compose up
```
Stop running containers and remove images to wipe the db before testing new API changes:
```
docker-compose down --rmi all
```
To open a terminal on the running app:
```
docker exec -it veyfly-web-1 bash
```
